###FSK600Bauds900Hz1500HzModulation
 
 This lib allows to establish a 600 Baud, 8N1 (8 databits, 1 stop bit, no parity) serial communication over a digital pin using FSK modulation (with 900Hz/1500Hz tones).
 
###FCOEV2
 
 This lib allows to easily drive FlyCamOneEcoV2 cameras (http://flycamone.com/CamOne/en/FC2410en.html), attached to digital IO pins
